\section{Scope}
The focus of our in-depth analysis phase will be to investigate exactly how the course creation works and what the limitations and possibilities are, and what kind of learning format would actually fit into the doctors’ schedule. The goal is to find out exactly how and where to focus our efforts to help the course creators model their content so the doctors will want to and be able to use it.

We consider our project to be either a situation 3 or 4, as described in Bødker, Kensing & Simonsen (2004), page 142, currently more a 4 than 3. We have limited knowledge of the actual structure of the work domains, and the organization and the amount of interest groups is quite high, putting us in a situation 4. This might change as we narrow our focus though, especially in regards to which course creators we ultimately ending up working with.
We need to gather more data on the work practices in our primary work domains and analyse them to focus our project.
