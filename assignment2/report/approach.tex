\section{Approach}
In our inline analysis phase we have conducted an initial interview with a representative of DMA and created a baseline plan. After completing the baseline plan, we performed document analysis in order to narrow our scope and research current e-learning solutions.

After this initial phase we went on to having a company visit at DMA and meeting with the representative of DMA. At the meeting we performed scope identification, functional analysis, identified possible stakeholders, contact persons and possible steering committee members. Accordingly we discussed further material that would be relevant to research to narrow our scope further.

Based on the meeting with the DMA representative we performed additional document analysis along with functional analysis.
