\section{Business strategy}
\subsection{Goals}
In the end, we aim to find an approach for doctors to learn course material that will work for the busy doctors. The approach should be realistic and feasible within the constraints of the target association DMA, and should actually engage the doctors and fit their needs so that the doctors will use it in practise.

\subsection{Business processes}
We do not consider business processes relevant at this time, as it is outside the scope of our study.

\subsection{Challenges and problems}
There are various challenges associated with solving the problem of doctors not actively continuing their education despite attempts to facilitate their learning. Firstly, we need to establish what is actually causing the problem. The cause seems to be that the doctors do not have time in their busy schedules to take hours or entire days off to study and take courses, but is this actually the main cause? Is there more to it? Are other factors in the way of doctors keeping up with their fields?

If the stated problem is confirmed to be what it seems to be, then we still have the problem of figuring out an alternative method of providing the course materials in a manner that is accessible to the doctors. And even with accessible learning, the approach still needs to motivate the doctors to actually use the solution. So we need to understand exactly what the doctors are looking for in a way of consuming courses and exactly what will suit their needs.
