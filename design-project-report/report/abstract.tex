\abstract{Doctors are mostly overly busy individuals with strict schedules. Engaging them with available learning material via digital platforms therefore requires a finely tuned approach that is able to catch the doctor in an available state where they are willing to discover opportunities to evolve their continuous professional development (CPD). In this report, we use the MUST method, a participatory design method that introduces innovative change to an organisation, to design and recommend a solution for the Danish Medical Association (DMA). In particular, we introduce our own method called Hook and Reel which tries to engage doctors in the smallest time-frame available (the hook) and have them discovering and using the material (the reel). We describe in detail the methods used that lead us to our findings, our coherent visions of change along with the illustrative prototypes that put our visions in a context of the existing systems found in DMAâ€™s domain. }
